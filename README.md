### Components

- FFFBeretsFace: The Beret's Face sheet as an overlay
- FFFSticky: The Sticky Leg sheet as an overlay
- FFFNormalOverlay: Overlays to meld the FFF sheet to vanilla
- FFFNormal: The FFF sheet
- Vanilla: The vanilla sheet

### Masks

Layers that aren't melding overlays have masks set to remove either parts that aren't covered by the replacing sheet (in the case of vanilla), or that aren't relevant (in the case of sticky and beret's face)

## shirts.psd

It's literally just three layers, with the normal and busty replacements separated out. Male shirts have been masked off.
